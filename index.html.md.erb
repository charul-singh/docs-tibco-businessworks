This documentation describes the TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition Buildpack for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition Buildpack provides the runtime component for developers to deploy BusinessWorks (BW) applications to a PCF deployment. 

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition enables developers to connect APIs and microservices in a drag-and-drop graphical development environment. A graphical data mapper and vast library of connectors allows developers to create cloud-native integration applications that run natively within PCF.

When a developer pushes a BW application to a PCF deployment, the TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition Buildpack detects the BW application, produces a tarball called a "droplet" that contains a lightweight version of the BW runtime along with the application files, and configures the runtime to run the application when the container starts. For more information about how PCF stages applications, see the [How Applications Are Staged](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/how-applications-are-staged.html#stage-buildpack) topic. 

To build applications for the runtime provided by the TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition Buildpack, developers must use the TIBCO Business Studio Container Edition development environment. See the [Requirements](#reqs) section below for more information.

The TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition runtime has the following features:

* **Batch-oriented**: provides non real-time integration for endpoints such as databases or files, and uses records for data abstraction
* **Process-oriented**: provides real-time integration for endpoints such as application APIs and adapters, and uses APIs, objects, and messages for data abstraction
* **Service-oriented**: provides real-time integration for endpoints such as web services and APIs, and uses services and messages for data abstraction
* **Resource-oriented**: provides real-time integration for endpoints such as mobile or web applications and APIs, and uses resources for data abstraction
